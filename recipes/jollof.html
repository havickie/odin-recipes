 <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Jollof rice is a delicacy that began in West Africa, but because of frequent cultural exchange amongst various regions, the recipe continues to spread far and wide. It is considered a celebratory dish and popular in West African nations like Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal.

Because there are so many variations, this jollof rice recipe is probably a combination of a lot of different interpretations.  There are ongoing debates across West Africa that argue which region prepares the best version of jollof rice.

Rich in flavor and history, spicy jollof rice is considered pretty sacred amongst the African community so I knew I needed to give it great respect when trying to recreate a version for my website.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>: Garlic, fresh ginger, and onions are sauteed at the start to give the rice an excellent flavor base.</li><br>
   <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: I prefer using canned crushed tomatoes. They mostly cook into the rice leaving small pieces, rather than large chunks in the rice which I prefer. The tomatoes will add a bit of sweetness to balance out the heat of the chili.</li><br>
   <li><strong>Spicy chilies</strong>: The rice is traditionally on the spicy side of things. I use habanero pepper for its unique fruity flavor but feel free to adjust the amount added depending on your preference for heat.</li><br>
   <li><strong>Chicken stock</strong>: Gives the rice more depth of flavor though you can use a vegetable-based stock for a vegan version.</li><br>
   <li>Basmati rice: Cooks up nice and fluffy.</li><br>
   <li><strong>Spices and herbs</strong>: We will use curry powder, dried thyme, smoked paprika, and a fresh bay leaf to deepen the flavor, making it warmer, smokier, and brighter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Cook the onions</strong> in the olive oil in a large pot until softened. Then add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds to release their fragrance. Stir frequently so they donâ€™t burn!</li>
   <li><strong>Add the rice</strong> stir it in the pot to toast it.</li>
   <li><strong>Add the stock</strong>, crushed tomatoes, seasoned salt, smoked paprika, curry powder, thyme, paprika, and bay leaf to the pot. Stir everything together and once it boils, cover it with a lid and cook until the liquid evaporates and the rice is tender.</li>
   <li><strong>Turn off the heat</strong> and allow the rice to rest with the lid on. Remove the bay leaf and stir everything together. Serve it up garnished with parsley and bay leaves.</li>
  </ol>
